This month, we got a nice rebound on the services side but manufacturing fell below the 50 level. Overall, the services side is a much more important component of the US economy so I take this as good news. That said, S&P says this number isn\'t exactly pointing to gangbusters growth.\n\nChris Williamson,\nChief Business Economist at S&P Global Market\nIntelligence"\n\n> “A welcome upturn in service sector activity in March has\n> helped propel stronger economic growth at the end of\n> the first quarter. However, the survey data are indicative\n> of the economy growing at an annualized 1.9% rate in\n> March and just 1.5% over the quarter as a whole, pointing\n> to a slowing of GDP growth compared to the end of 2024.\n\n> "Near-term risks also seem tilted to the downside.\n> Growth is concentrated in the service sector as\n> manufacturing fell back into decline after the front-\n> running of tariffs had temporarily boosted factory output\n> in the first two months of the year. Similarly, some of the\n> March upturn in services was reportedly due to business\n> picking up after adverse weather conditions had\n> dampened activity across many states in January and\n> February, which could prove a temporary bounce.\n\n> "Business confidence in the outlook has also darkened,\n> souring further from the buoyant mood seen at the start\n> of the year to one of the gloomiest readings seen over\n> the past three years, largely caused by growing worries\n> over negative impacts from recent policy initiatives from\n> the new administration. Most widely cited were concerns\n> about the impact of Federal spending cuts and tariffs.\n\n> "A key concern over tariffs is the impact on inflation, with\n> the March survey indicating a further sharp rise in costs\n> as suppliers pass tariff-related price hikes on to US\n> companies. Firms\' costs are now rising at the steepest\n> rate for nearly two years, with factories increasingly\n> passing these higher costs onto customers.

Source:S&P Global PMI. 2024S&PGlobal.\n\n# Overview\n\nUS business activity growth accelerated sharply to its fastest for just over two years in May, according to provisional PMI survey data from S&P Global, signalling an improved economic performance midway through the second quarter. The service sector led the upturn, reporting the largest output rise for a year, but manufacturing also showed stronger growth.\n\nAlthough companies continued to report lower employment, the rate of job losses moderated amid improved business confidence for the year ahead and higher order book intakes.\n\nBoth input costs and output prices meanwhile rose at faster rates, with manufacturing having taken over as the main source of price growth over the past two months. However, the overall rate of selling price inflation remained below the average seen over the past year.\n\n# Output and demand\n\nThe headline S&P Global Flash US PMI Composite Output Index rose sharply from 51.3 in April to 54.4 in May, its highest since April 2022. The 3.1 index point rise (the largest gain for 15 months) signals a marked acceleration of growth midway through the second quarter. Output has now risen continually for 16 consecutive months, with May’s acceleration contrasting with the slowdown seen in March and April.\n\nMay’s improved performance was led by the service sector, where business activity surged higher to register the fastest growth for a year, reversing the slowdown seen over the prior three months. Services activity has now risen for 16 straight months. Inflows of new work into the service sector also picked up, having slipped into decline in April, registering one of the strongest gains seen over the past year, though demand was again subdued by a further fall in services exports.\n\nThe services sector upturn was accompanied by manufacturing output also expanding at an increased pace in May. Factory production rose for a fourth consecutive month. The latest output gain was still lower than seen earlier in the year, however, thanks to a weaker new orders performance compared to that seen at the start of the year. New orders received by factories declined for the second month running, but at only a marginal pace amid the largest export gain for two years.\n\nOptimism about output in the year ahead lifted higher in both manufacturing and services in response to brighter business prospects, the latter in turn often linked to expansion plans, new products and increased marketing. Customers were also reported to have likewise become more optimistic.\n\nHowever, although future output expectations improved from April’s five-month low, levels of confidence remained below long-run averages in both sectors. Companies continued to report uncertainty about the economic outlook given the possibility of higher-for-longer interest rates, upcoming elections, and wider geopolitical uncertainties.\n\n# News Release\n\n# Employment\n\nEmployment fell for a second successive month in May, contrasting with the continual hiring trend seen over the prior 45 months. The overall reduction in workforce numbers was only very marginal, however, and less than witnessed in April, as an upturn in manufacturing payrolls was accompanied by a slower rate of job shedding in services.\n\nWhile factory jobs grew at the fastest rate for ten months in May, buoyed by rising order books and improved business prospects, services employment has now fallen for two successive months, albeit in part due to staff shortages.\n\n# Prices\n\nS&P Global Flash US PMI price indices\n\n![](https://www.pmi.spglobal.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/images/db63b5c11464ff87d88544b3ec5459d379bcaeac4696d1a7eca0832ab30cd056.jpg)\n\nData compiled May 23, 2024. Index, sa, $>50=$ inflation since previous month Source: S&P Global PMI. @ 2024 S&P Global.\n\nInput prices continued to rise sharply in May, the rate of inflation accelerating to register the second-largest monthly increase seen over the past eight months. Manufacturers reported an especially steep increase, suffering the largest cost rise for one-and-a-half years amid reports of higher supplier prices for a wide variety of inputs, including metals, chemicals, plastics, and timberbased products, as well as higher energy and labor costs. Service sector costs also rose at an increased rate, reflecting higher staffing costs in particular.\n\nCompanies again sought to pass higher costs onto customers in the form of higher selling prices, the rate of increase of which accelerated slightly compared to April. However, although still elevated by pre-pandemic standards, the rate of inflation across both goods and services remained below the average recorded over the past year.\n\n# Manufacturing PMI\n\nThe S&P Global Flash US Manufacturing PMI rose from 50.0 in April to 50.9 in May to signal an overall modest improvement in business conditions within the goodsproducing sector. Although below readings seen in February and March, the latest PMI is the third-highest recorded over the past 20 months.\n\nBoth output and employment made increasingly positive contributions to the PMI compared to April, while the drags from new orders and stocks of purchases components moderated.\n\nSuppliers’ delivery times quickened marginally on average during the month, indicating less busy suppliers and hence acting as a further minor drag on the PMI.\n\n![](https://www.pmi.spglobal.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/images/3786bb4ee08130403fff22843e989c5b0e4e09155bb80fd836ba2506882bb334.jpg)\n\nUSManufacturingPMIanditscomponents\n\nData compiled May 23, 2024.

Source: S&P Global PMI. 2024 S&P Global.\n\n# Comment\n\nCommenting on the data, Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence said:\n\n“The US economic upturn has accelerated again after two months of slower growth, with the early PMI data signalling the fastest expansion for just over two years in May. The data put the US economy back on course for another solid GDP gain in the second quarter.\n\n“Not only has output risen in response to renewed order book growth, but business confidence has lifted higher to signal brighter prospects for the year ahead. However, companies remain cautious with respect to the economic outlook amid uncertainty over the future path of inflation and interest rates, and continue to cite worries over geopolitical instabilities and the presidential election.\n\n“Selling price inflation has meanwhile ticked higher and continues to signal modestly above-target inflation. What’s interesting is that the main inflationary impetus is now coming from manufacturing rather than services, meaning rates of inflation for costs and selling prices are now somewhat elevated by pre-pandemic standards in both sectors to suggest that the final mile down to the Fed’s $2%$ target still seems elusive.”\n\n# News Release\n\n![](https://www.pmi.spglobal.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/images/3558c06c989e7953df302efde7e4e6147a58f6b00c4cca5399d414b80196b0eb.jpg)\n\nS&P Global FlashUS PMI vs gross domestic product(GDP)\n\nSources:S&PGlobal PMIBureau of Economic Analysisvia S&P Global Market Intelligence ? 2024 S&P Global. \\*PMI Manufacturing Output Index May\'07-Sep "09\n\n![](https://www.pmi.spglobal.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/images/75bff38e015014466c44f1ba1976e61e36f9468f2750de34720ba70ac9a42730.jpg)\n\nUS inflation and the flash PMI output prices index\n\nData compiled May 23, 2024.

The flash estimate is based on around $85%$ of total PMI survey responses each month and is designed to provide an accurate advance indication of the final PMI data.\n\nThe average differences between the flash and final PMI index values (final minus flash) since comparisons were first available in October 2009 are as follows (differences in absolute terms provide the better indication of true variation while average differences provide a better indication of any bias):\n\n![](https://www.pmi.spglobal.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/images/c01219716534f6b708f03b47a25cc3b5ce6caff5bb4b208b9fd6a097004b951f.jpg)\n\nThe Purchasing Managers’ Index™ $(P M P)$ survey methodology has developed an outstanding reputation for providing the most up-to-date possible indication of what is really happening in the private sector economy by tracking variables such as sales, employment, inventories and prices. The indices are widely used by businesses, governments and economic analysts in financial institutions to help better understand business conditions and guide corporate and investment strategy. In particular, central banks in many countries (including the European Central Bank) use the data to help make interest rate decisions. $\\\\bar{P M}I^{\\\\mathfrak{m}}$ surveys are the first indicators of economic conditions published each month and are therefore available well ahead of comparable data produced by government bodies.\n\nS&P Global do not revise underlying survey data after first publication, but seasonal adjustment factors may be revised from time to time as appropriate which will affect the seasonally adjusted data series. Historical data relating to the underlying (unadjusted) numbers, first published seasonally adjusted series and subsequently revised data are available to subscribers from S&P Global.

The Composite Output PMI is a weighted average of the Manufacturing Output Index and the Services Business Activity Index.\n2. The Services Business Activity Index is the direct equivalent of the Manufacturing Output Index, based on the survey question “Is the level of business activity at your company higher, the same or lower than one month ago?”\n3. The Manufacturing PMI is a composite index based on a weighted combination of the following five survey variables (weights shown in brackets): new orders (0.3); output (0.25); employment (0.2); suppliers’ delivery times (0.15); stocks of materials purchased (0.1). The delivery times index is inverted.\n4. The Manufacturing Output Index is based on the survey question “Is the level of production/output at your company higher, the same or lower than one month ago?”\n\n# News Release\n\n# S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI)\n\nS&P Global provides essential intelligence.

  "forecast": "Market expectations for the May 2025 S&P Flash U.S. Services PMI are centered around a forecast of 51.0. The actual figure for April 2025 was 50.8, slightly below expectations (51.4), suggesting some muted optimism. Negative external factors have increased concerns in recent reports.",
  "history": "In the April 2025 report, the Service PMI stood at 50.8, indicating minimal growth and falling short of the anticipated 51.4. The March 2025 report showed a higher figure of 54.3, exceeding expectations of 50.8 and highlighting a robust recovery [1,2,3].",
  "significance": "The S&P Flash U.S. Services PMI is a critical economic indicator that assesses business conditions in the services sector, which constitutes a significant portion of the U.S. economy. A reading above 50 suggests expansion, while below 50 indicates contraction. This data informs market participants about economic trends and influences interest rates, inflation expectations, and overall market sentiment. Significant deviations from expectations can drive market volatility.",
  "latest_news": "Recent articles highlight the influence of geopolitical uncertainties and broader policy adjustments on economic outlook. Stress is being placed on weaker manufacturing data, fluctuating employment trends, and the impact of recent tariff discussions on inflation and business confidence. The latest reports indicate a slight slowdown in economic growth compared to prior months [1,2,3].",

    "For Bullish Sentiment": {
      "ETFs": "SPDR S&P 500 (SPY)",
      "Trade Execution": "If the PMI figure significantly exceeds expectations, suggesting a strong expansion in the services sector, it may indicate a positive outlook for equities. Traders could consider buying SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF), which follows the performance of the S&P 500 index, as a proxy for market-wide exposure.",
      "Sector-Specific": "Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RYE): This ETF provides an equal-weight exposure to the S&P 500 sectors, which may have a broader and more diversified impact during a broad market uptick."

    "For Bearish Sentiment": {
      "ETFs": "Invesco ProShares Short S&P500 (SH) or ProShares Ultrashort S&P500 (SSO)",
      "Trade Execution": "Conversely, if the PMI figure falls short of expectations, indicating a potential slowdown or contraction, traders might consider taking a short position using inverse ETFs such as SH or SSO to benefit from the expected market decline."
