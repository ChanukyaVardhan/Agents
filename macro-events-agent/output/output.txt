In other words, the indicator reflects how many people lost their jobs during the given period.\n\nThe indicator is used to assess the state of the labor market and general US economy health. Since the weekly flow of data show high volatility, [four-week average values](https://www.mql5.com/en/economic-calendar/united-states/initial-jobless-claims-4-week-average) are often monitored instead. High volatility can stem from different factors. For example, there can be less claims due to a reduced working week (during holidays or vacations).\n\nThe systematic growth of the indicator points to a weakening of the labor market and to an increase in unemployment. Initial jobless claims typically rise before the economy enters the recession. Conversely, they may decline before the economy starts to recover. Therefore, it is considered a strong leading indicator of the US economy health.\n\nIn addition, the Fed takes into account the state of the labor market in its interest rate decision. So, the growth of jobless claims registered for several weeks in a row can have a negative effect on US dollar quotes.\n\n#### Last values:\n\nactual data\n\n\nforecast\n\n\nThe chart of the entire available history of the "United States Initial Jobless Claims" macroeconomic indicator.\nThe dashed line shows the forecast values \u200b\u200bof the economic indicator for the specified dates.\n\nA significant deviation of a real value from a forecast one may cause a short-term strengthening or weakening of a national currency in the Forex market.

# Instructions
- For numbers, use only data scraped from the web search content.
- If you don't have enough data about the forecast or historical data, don't make up numbers.
- Since the content is scraped, you might find irrelevant and unstructured content. Pick only relevant information from that.
- You can use your own knowledge when explaining details about importance of the event.
- For references, list down all the urls that you referred the content from.
- Provide citations for the content generated.

Your output must be a JSON object with the following structure. Make sure it is a valid JSON format. Your output should only contain the json response without any further text:
```json
{
  "event_details": "A broad title for the event along with date and time.",
  "forecast": "Summarize current market expectations (monthly and annual changes if relevant), including consensus figures and expert/analyst projections. Mention key trends or market sentiment leading into the event.",
  "history": "Briefly outline what happened in the previous month's report, and how markets or analysts interpreted that. Mention any notable surprises or shifts in underlying data. Include relevant YoY and MoM comparisons. Quote reliable sources (with attribution and embedded URLs).",
  "significance": "Explain why this event matters for markets. What does the data typically indicate? What could a surprise in either direction (stronger or weaker data) imply for equities, yields, Fed policy, or inflation expectations? Include any sectoral or macroeconomic implications.",
  "latest_news": "Summarize what the most recent articles (provided) are reporting or predicting. Are there any new factors at play (e.g., policy changes, geopolitical tensions, weather events, etc.) that may affect this release or its interpretation?",
  "etfs": "Explain the ETFs I can trade that have high impact for this event, along with how to do execute the trade based on the direction of the results",

  "event_details": "United States Initial Jobless Claims Release, May 22, 2025, at 08:30 AM GMT",
  "forecast": "The market expects initial jobless claims to be around 230K for the upcoming release on May 22, 2025. This remains within the range of the seasonally adjusted figures reported in recent months. The trend indicates some volatility in the claims, reflecting ongoing labor market conditions and potential unforeseen economic factors.",
  "history": "The latest actual data reported on May 15, 2025, showed 229K initial jobless claims, with no change from the previous week’s figures. The initial jobless claims had previously seen a small peak of 241K in late April 2025, which may suggest a temporary spike in unemployment filings. The current figures indicate that the labor market might be stabilizing, with small fluctuations suggesting that underlying economic conditions are gradually improving.",
  "significance": "This report is crucial as it provides an early indication of the labor market's health, influencing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. High jobless claims can signal potential recessions or economic downturns, causing investor sentiment to decline. Conversely, lower claims suggest a robust labor market which can boost investor confidence and drive equities upward.",
  "latest_news": "Recent news articles and analyses highlight ongoing volatility in the stock market, with various macroeconomic factors in play. Market commentators expect robust earnings, especially in the tech sector, to drive growth despite economic uncertainties. Geopolitical tensions and trade dynamics might continue to be factors affecting the labor market and broader economic outlook.",
  "etfs": [
    {
      "etf": "SPD/Total Stock Market ETF (SPTM)",
      "direction": "Higher-than-expected jobless claims, coupled with other economic indicators suggesting a downturn, can lead to negative market sentiment. Shorting this ETF could capitalize on potential declines in broader market indices.",
      "trade_idea": "A short position or utilizing bear market strategies might be beneficial given the likelihood of higher volatility and market declines due to economic downturn forecasts."
    },
    {
      "etf": "iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF (GOVT)",
      "direction": "In times of economic uncertainty, investors often flock to U.S. Treasuries, driving bond prices higher and yields lower. Thus, when jobless claims rise exponentially, the GOVT ETF might see a spike in demand.",
      "trade_idea": "An inverse relationship with equities means traders might want to 'long' the GOVT to profit from a 'flight to safety' during heightened economic concerns."
